# Phonebook Back-End

- This Project was created while following along with part 3 of FullStackOpen2021.  
- This repository is *only for the back-end* of the app.  If you need to make changes to the front-end, you need to visit [phonebook-frontend](https://github.com/ashermanli/fullstackopen/tree/master/phonebook)
- After creating the front-end of the application, we are now implementing our own backend with Nodejs and Express.
- A server written with Express has routes to change the state of the application by creating, updating, or deleting entries from a MongodDB store. 
- Routes are written to gather all entries, or to specify a specific entry for selection. 
- Each entry can be updated or deleted, with no two entries being identical to each other. 

## Features
--------

- Includes a search feature for existing entries
- Includes a notification pop-up to indicate success or error
- Entries are validated to make sure they are in the correct format for database model

## Installation
------------
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ashermanli/phonebook-backend.git

#Enter the created folder
$ cd phonebook-backend

#Install dependencies
$ npm install

#Run the app
$ npm start

# Open localhost:3001 in browser

```

## Objectives and Outcomes
This project was the final chapter in part 3 of FullStackOpen2021.  This project allowed me to learn about the backend of a MERN app and how to properly 
create routes for the back-end.  Connecting it with the front-end and deploying the app to production was also a great resource for learning.  I feel confident 
I can create interesting apps for myself and others that can be deployed and presented to the world.
